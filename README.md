# prototypeSIM
Simple prototype for a path finding simulator using raylib

To run this code you must clone and build the raylib library found at: https://github.com/raysan5/raylib

A makefile is provided to compile the code into a single executable. The compiler clang is used, but it can be changed to gcc or any other of your preference, just change the 'compiler' variable.
